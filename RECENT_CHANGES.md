# Recent Changes - Removed Instructions Window

## âœ… Changes Made

### 1. **PublicDashboard.tsx**
- **Removed**: "How to Access Files" instructions card/window
- **Removed**: `showInstructions` state variable
- **Updated**: `handleFileClick` callback to remove instructions-related logic
- **Updated**: `getFileIcon` function to remove instructions icon handling
- **Removed**: Unused `Info` icon import

### 2. **googleDriveSimple.ts**
- **Removed**: Instructions file from sample files array
- **Removed**: `getAccessInstructions()` method (no longer needed)
- **Simplified**: Sample files now only include the main folder access link

## ðŸŽ¯ Result

The public dashboard now has a **cleaner, more streamlined interface** with:
- âœ… Direct access to Google Drive folder via prominent button
- âœ… Embedded iframe view for browsing files within the app
- âœ… No additional instruction overlays or pop-ups
- âœ… Simplified user experience focused on direct folder access

## ðŸš€ Current State

- **Application**: Running successfully at http://localhost:8081
- **Public Access**: Available at http://localhost:8081/public
- **Interface**: Clean and distraction-free
- **Functionality**: Full Google Drive folder access maintained

The removal of the instructions window makes the interface more professional and less cluttered while maintaining all core functionality.
