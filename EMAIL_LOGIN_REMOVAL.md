# Email Login Removal

## Overview
Removed the email-based login functionality from the curriculum vault drive application as requested. The application now exclusively uses Google OAuth authentication, with the exception of invitation-based registration.

## Changes Made

### 1. LoginForm.tsx Updates
**File:** `/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx`

**Changes:**
- **Removed email login logic**: Replaced the regular email login path with a message indicating that email login is no longer supported
- **Updated form display**: When no invitation token is present, the form now shows an informational message instead of email input field
- **Preserved invitation flow**: Invitation-based registration still works and uses email input for pre-filled invitation data

**Before:**
```tsx
// Handle regular login
const user = await userService.login(email);
if (user) {
  setUser(user);
  toast({
    title: "Login Successful",
    description: `Welcome back, ${user.name}!`,
  });
  onLogin();
} else {
  toast({
    title: "Login Failed",
    description: "Invalid email address.",
    variant: "destructive",
  });
}
```

**After:**
```tsx
// Email login is no longer supported
toast({
  title: "Login Method Not Supported",
  description: "Please use Google OAuth login instead.",
  variant: "destructive",
});
```

### 2. UserService.ts Updates
**File:** `/src/services/userService.ts`

**Changes:**
- **Removed `login(email)` function**: Completely removed the email-based authentication method
- **Preserved other functions**: All other user service functions remain intact (getCurrentUser, logout, Google Drive settings, invitation management)

**Removed function:**
```tsx
async login(email: string): Promise<User | null> {
  // Entire function removed - no longer needed
}
```

### 3. LandingPage.tsx Updates
**File:** `/src/components/LandingPage.tsx`

**Changes:**
- **Updated comment**: Changed misleading comment about "regular login" to accurately reflect that the fallback is for invitation-based registration

**Before:**
```tsx
// Fallback to regular login form if Google login fails
```

**After:**
```tsx
// Fallback to login form for invitation-based registration or error handling
```

## What Still Works

### ✅ Google OAuth Authentication
- Primary authentication method
- Admin role assignment based on email addresses
- Token management and refresh
- Google Drive integration

### ✅ Invitation-Based Registration
- Email invitations still function
- Pre-filled email from invitation data
- Name input for new user registration
- Invitation validation and acceptance

### ✅ User Management
- Current user retrieval from localStorage
- User logout functionality
- Role-based access control
- Admin user management interface

## What Was Removed

### ❌ Direct Email Login
- No longer possible to login with just an email address
- Removed simple email validation and user creation
- Removed "Invalid email address" error handling
- Removed localStorage-based user creation via email

## Impact Analysis

### Positive Impact
- **Simplified authentication**: Single authentication method (Google OAuth)
- **Better security**: OAuth provides stronger authentication than simple email validation
- **Reduced complexity**: Less code to maintain and fewer authentication paths
- **Consistent UX**: All users go through the same OAuth flow

### No Breaking Changes
- **Existing users**: Users already authenticated via Google OAuth are unaffected
- **Invitation system**: Still fully functional for new user onboarding
- **Admin functions**: All administrative capabilities preserved
- **Google Drive integration**: Unchanged functionality

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Google OAuth flow**: Ensure login/logout works correctly
2. **Test invitation system**: Verify email invitations and registration still work
3. **Test admin functions**: Confirm user management features work
4. **Test unauthorized access**: Verify appropriate handling when email login is attempted
5. **Test role assignment**: Ensure admin emails still get Admin role via OAuth

## Future Considerations

- The invitation system still uses email input, which is appropriate for its use case
- Consider adding additional OAuth providers if needed (GitHub, Microsoft, etc.)
- The admin email list is still hardcoded - consider moving to environment variables for production
